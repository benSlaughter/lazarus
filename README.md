Minecraft datapack for managing deaths and such! This is just for fun!

I'm following a tutorial on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/96vJcUBS7Kw  
The data pack scaffold has been shamelessly copied from there.

## What is the goal of this datapack

This datapack should give you a way to be able to "buy" extra lives, and when you are out, just like hardcore mode, the is no more respawning.

1. Create some sort of token that you can purchase
1. Have one token removed from you when you die
1. Impliment some way to purchase tokens
1. Stop the player being able to play if they die with 0 tokens
1. Enable friends to spend their tokens to revive playes
